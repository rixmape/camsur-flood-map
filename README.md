# Flood Mapping with Sentinel-1 RTC SAR Data During STS Kristine in Camarines Sur Province, Philippines

This project demonstrates the use of Sentinel-1 Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for flood mapping during the passage of Tropical Storm Kristine (Trami) in Camarines Sur Province, Philippines on October 2024.

## Data Sources

The Sentinel-1 On-Demand RTC products used in this project are generated by the Alaskan Satellite Facility (ASF) through the GAMMA Software and are available through the ASF Vertex Data Search Portal. The RTC products are processed from the following Sentinel-1 Level-1 Ground Range Detected (GRD) data:

- May 26, 2024 (Pre-flood)
  - S1A_IW_GRDH_1SSV_20240526T095854_20240526T095928_054041_069204_920F
  - S1A_IW_GRDH_1SSV_20240526T095829_20240526T095854_054041_069204_9FD7
- October 29, 2024 (Post-flood)
  - S1A_IW_GRDH_1SSV_20241029T095856_20241029T095921_056316_06E5CD_50F8
  - S1A_IW_GRDH_1SSV_20241029T095831_20241029T095856_056316_06E5CD_18FF

These products share the following characteristics:

- Platform: Sentinel-1A
- Beam Mode: Interferometric Wide (IW) Swath
- Polarization: Single VV
- Processing Level: Level 1 GRD High-Resolution Detected (GRDH)
- Resolution: 10 meters
- Relative Orbit: 69
- Flight Direction: Ascending

> **On five-month interval of pre- and post-flood data:** Since this is an entry-level flood mapping project, I decided to prioritize consistent relative orbits over temporal proximity. This ensure consistent viewing geometry and eliminates several potential sources of error in change detection. These products also provides full coverage of the study area. I plan to explore alternative approaches in future projects.

These GRDH products can be downloaded through the bulk downloader script in [`scripts/bulk_downloader_gdrhs.py`](scripts/bulk_downloader_gdrhs.py).

For the RTC products, you can use the following processing parameters:

- Radiometry: gamma0
- Scale: decibel
- Pixel spacing: 10 meters
- DEM Matching: disabled
- Speckle Filtering: enabled
- Optional Files: DEM and Incidence Angle Map

See [`docs/rtc_flood_mapping.md`](docs/rtc_flood_mapping.md) for the reasoning behind these parameters.
